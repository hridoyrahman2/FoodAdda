            <h2>Autumn Soup</h2>
            <p>In Chicago, soup season lasts from September to…well, way later than it should. I make soup recipes the whole way through, but I especially crave them now, in the heart of autumn. These 3 easy soup recipes are my favorites at this time of year. They’re cozy, comforting, and filled with aromatic flavor from herbs like rosemary, sage, and thyme.</p>

            <h2>Penne All’Arrabiata</h2>
            <p>Pasta all'arrabiata, a classic Italian recipe, is my comfort food be it summer or winter. My kids and I love sprinkling "pangrattato" (fried bread crumbs) on top of the arrabiata sauce.  </p>

            <h2>Punjabi Aloo Paratha</h2>
            <p>This Aloo Paratha Recipe is an authentic Indian Breakfast, generally served with Pickle, Curd or with a glass of Lassi. Today I have made this Paratha in a different way with lot of stuffing, than the normal Paratha that we generally make at home.</p>
